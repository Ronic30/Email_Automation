# Email_Automation
EMAIL_AUTOMATION using Python, where you can send a reminder using the Python script.

Library used: pandas, date, and smtplib(simple mail transfer protocol).

How it Works :
  1. Fetch the data from a spreadsheet by converting the spreadsheet into a CSV file to use it in a Python script.
  2. Spreadsheet includes attributes like: name, project, due_date,
  3. We'll make a variable named present_date where we store the present date.
  4. So when a date is passed, it automatically sends the email to the user as a reminder.
