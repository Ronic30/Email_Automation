Q4. Write a Python program that reads a file named sentences.txt, extracts all words, and analyzes the
frequency of each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) across all words. Your program should:
 Convert the entire text to lowercase and remove punctuation.
 Count how many times each vowel appears.
 Store the results in a dictionary in the format: vowel: count.
 Write the dictionary to a file named vowel_counts.txt.
 Convert the vowel counts to a NumPy array and compute:
 Total vowels
 Average vowel count
 Most and least frequent vowels
 Plot a bar graph of the vowel frequencies using Matplotlib.
